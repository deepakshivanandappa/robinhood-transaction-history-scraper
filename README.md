# robinhood-transaction-history-scraper


In the era of retail investors and Robinhood being at the epicenter of all frenzy investing chaos, if retail investors wonder "can we download all our transactions history?", then the answer is, unfortunately, 'no'.

So, using this [article](https://anonovation.medium.com/how-to-download-your-robinhood-transaction-history-357b1ff4df15) as a reference, I have created this JavaScript that helps to download all transaction history from Robinhood very easily.




Steps to follow - 

1. go to https://robinhood.com/account/history
2. scroll down to the bottom of the page
3. open the developer tool from the browser
4. paste this [javascript code](https://github.com/deepshiv126/robinhood-transaction-history-scraper/blob/main/robinhood-transaction-history-scraper.js) into the console and hit enter   


Boom!! all the transaction history is ready to be download in csv format.
