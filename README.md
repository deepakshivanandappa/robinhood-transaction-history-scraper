In the era of retail investors and robinhood being at the epicenter of all frenzy investing chaos, if retail investors wonder "can we download all our transactions history?", then answer is unfortunately 'no'.

So, using this [article](https://anonovation.medium.com/how-to-download-your-robinhood-transaction-history-357b1ff4df15) has a reference, I have created this javascript that helps to download all transaction history from robinhood very easily.

Steps to follow - 
1. go to https://robinhood.com/account/history
2. scroll down to the bottom of page
3. open the developer tool from the browser
4. paste this code into the console and hit enter   

Boom!! all the transaction history is ready to be download in csv format.
